My game is about mental health issues. I’ve been struggling with these problems
for a long time, especially with congenital conditions like face blindness and
ADHD. These make it hard for me to see the world like others do, and keep my
mind in an abnormal state for long periods, leading to bipolar disorder. Living with
mental illness isn’t easy. You never know when something might trigger a
breakdown, leaving you trembling or even in emergency room — yes, I’ve been
through that (and psychiatric ER visits are very expensive).
Yet, I’ve noticed that some people don’t see mental illness as a serious issue;
some even think it’s “cool.” They try to “get” a mental illness to stand out or lie
about having one to gain my sympathy. As someone almost born into mental
illness, this offends me deeply. So in this work, I reveal the terrifying side of
mental illness as I’ve experienced it — from uncontrollable self-harm to
hallucinations and panic attacks. Come, try doing what I’ve done, and feel the
real suffering that comes with mental illness. After going through all this, would
you still wish for a mental illness?
In this game, three seemingly simple games — Minesweeper, Whack-a-Mole,
and Maze Adventure — serve as metaphors for the struggles I’ve faced.
Combining a calendar with Minesweeper symbolizes the unpredictable nature of
mental illness, where you never know when it might strike. Whack-a-Mole
represents the uncontrollable urge for self-harm, and the shaky lines in the Maze
Adventure mirror the uncontrollable trembling during a panic attack.
